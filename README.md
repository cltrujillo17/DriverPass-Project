# 📄 DriverPass Project – System Analysis and Design

## 🔍 Project Summary  
The DriverPass project was a system design challenge for a client offering online and in-person driver’s education services. The client, DriverPass, needed a platform where students could register, take practice tests, schedule driving lessons, and track their progress. The system also needed tools for secretaries, IT personnel, and DMV integration to manage users, appointments, reports, and compliance updates.

## ✅ What I Did Well  
I feel that I did particularly well in clearly organizing the system’s use cases and mapping them to functional requirements. My UML diagrams, especially the activity diagram for scheduling appointments, effectively captured the system’s user flows in a way that both developers and clients could understand.

## ✏️ What I Would Improve  
If I could revise one part of my work, I would improve the sequence diagram. While it covered the key steps, I would add more detail around system interactions and include clearer visual spacing for easier readability.

## 👥 Understanding User Needs  
To design the system, I carefully reviewed the business requirements and interpreted user roles based on the interview transcript. I broke down the needs of each user type—students, staff, IT, and DMV—and made sure the system supported their tasks without overwhelming them with technical complexity. Understanding the user's needs is essential to creating intuitive, effective systems that solve real problems and get used.

## 🧠 Design Approach and Future Strategy  
I approach software design by first identifying the core use cases and mapping them out visually before writing technical specs. In the future, I plan to continue using a mix of object-oriented and process modeling, supported by tools like Lucidchart and agile documentation. Listening carefully to the user and iterating based on feedback is key to building systems that are both useful and maintainable.
